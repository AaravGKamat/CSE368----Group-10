The Single-Cycle Datapath 

The single-cycle datapath is a foundational design in computer architecture where every instruction in a processor's instruction set is executed within one single, continuous clock cycle. This design philosophy simplifies the conceptual understanding of how a CPU works, as the entire journey of an instruction—from fetch to completion—happens in one coordinated, atomic step.

The datapath itself is the collection of functional units and registers connected by buses that data flows through. For a typical instruction like an add operation (ADD rd, rs, rt), the datapath springs into action. First, the Program Counter (PC) sends an address to the instruction memory to fetch the instruction. This instruction word is then decoded, separating out the fields for the register file addresses (rs and rt).

In the decode stage, the register file reads the values from the two specified source registers. Simultaneously, the control unit, which examines the instruction's opcode, generates the necessary signals to steer the data correctly (e.g., telling the ALU what operation to perform). Next comes the execute stage, where the two register values are sent to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) to be added together.

The result of the ALU operation is then written back into the destination register (rd) during the write-back stage, completing the instruction.

The critical constraint of this design is that the clock cycle must be long enough to accommodate the slowest possible instruction. While a simple ADD might complete quickly, a instruction that requires reading from data memory (like a LOAD) has a much longer propagation delay. This means the clock cycle is dictated by the worst-case path, making the single-cycle design inherently inefficient, as faster instructions are forced to wait for the full cycle to finish.

Despite this inefficiency, the single-cycle datapath is a crucial first step. It provides a clear, unambiguous model for understanding the fundamental components of a CPU—the ALU, register file, and memories—and how they interconnect to bring software instructions to life.

<>Question: What is the defining characteristic of a single-cycle datapath?
**Answer: Every instruction is executed within one single, continuous clock cycle.

<>Question: What component holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched from instruction memory?
**Answer: The Program Counter (PC).

<>Question: What is the primary role of the control unit in the datapath?
**Answer: To examine the instruction's opcode and generate the necessary signals to steer the data correctly.

<>Question: What is the major performance drawback of the single-cycle datapath design?
**Answer: The clock cycle must be long enough to accommodate the slowest possible instruction, forcing faster instructions to wait.

<>Question: For a typical ADD instruction, what are the four main stages it goes through in the datapath?
**Answer: Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Write-back.

<>Question: Why is the single-cycle datapath considered a 'crucial first step' in computer architecture, despite its inefficiency?
**Answer: It provides a clear, unambiguous model for understanding the fundamental components of a CPU and how they interconnect.

<>Question: Explain how the 'worst-case path' for an instruction like LOAD negatively impacts the performance of a simple instruction like ADD.
**Answer: Because the clock cycle must be long enough for the slow LOAD instruction to complete, the faster ADD instruction is forced to use this entire long cycle, wasting time that it doesn't need.

<>Question: During which stage of the instruction's journey is the result of the ALU operation stored in the destination register (rd)?
**Answer: The Write-back stage.

<>Question: What functional unit performs the actual arithmetic or logical operation (like addition) during the execute stage?
**Answer: The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

<>Question: The datapath is described as a 'collection of functional units and registers connected by buses.' In the context of the ADD instruction, what is the specific role of the register file?
**Answer: To read the values from the two specified source registers (rs and rt) during the decode stage."
