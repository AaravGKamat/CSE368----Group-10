Electric Circuits

An electric circuit is a closed, conducting pathway that allows electrical current—a flow of electric charge—to move continuously, transferring energy from a source to a load. It is the fundamental backbone of all modern electronics, a system designed to control the path of electrons to perform useful work, from lighting a room to processing complex data.

Every circuit requires three fundamental components. First, a voltage source, such as a battery or generator, provides the electrical potential energy, acting as the "pump" that pushes the charges. Second, the circuit must consist of conductors, typically copper wires, that form a continuous path for the current to flow. Third, there is a load—a device like a light bulb, motor, or computer chip—that converts the electrical energy into another form, such as light, heat, or motion. Crucially, the path must be complete; a break anywhere in the loop, such as an open switch, stops the current entirely.

Circuits can be arranged in two primary ways. In a series circuit, components are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for the current. The same current flows through every part, but if one component fails, the entire circuit is broken. In a parallel circuit, components are connected across common points, creating multiple, independent branches. This configuration allows different devices to operate separately; if one light bulb in a parallel string burns out, the others remain lit, a principle used in all home wiring.

The behavior of a circuit is governed by Ohm's Law, which states that the voltage (V) across a component is equal to the current (I) flowing through it multiplied by its resistance (R), or V=IR. Resistance, measured in ohms (Ω), opposes the flow of current, and managing this relationship is key to circuit design.

From the microscopic pathways on a silicon microchip to the vast grid that powers nations, electric circuits are the engineered circulatory systems of our technological world, enabling the controlled and powerful application of electrical energy that defines modern life.
