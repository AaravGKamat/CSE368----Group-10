Evolution

Evolution is the fundamental scientific theory that explains how life on Earth has changed and diversified over billions of years. It describes the process by which species gradually transform through successive generations, driven by mechanisms that alter the genetic makeup of populations.

The core mechanism of evolution is natural selection, often called "survival of the fittest." This process occurs because individuals within a population naturally vary in their heritable traits. Those with characteristics better suited to their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass those advantageous traits to their offspring. Over time, these beneficial traits become more common in the population, leading to adaptation. For example, moths in soot-covered industrial areas evolved darker wings for better camouflage.

The raw material for evolution is genetic variation, which arises from mutations—random changes in an organism's DNA—and the reshuffling of genes during sexual reproduction. While evolution acts on individuals, its effects are seen across entire populations over immense timescales. The evidence for evolution is vast and drawn from multiple fields, including the fossil record, which shows a clear succession of life forms; comparative anatomy, which reveals similar bone structures in different species (homology); and molecular biology, which demonstrates universal genetic codes and shared DNA sequences among related organisms.

Ultimately, evolution explains the stunning biodiversity of our planet, illustrating how all living things, from bacteria to blue whales, share a common ancestry and have been shaped by the relentless and powerful forces of their environments.
