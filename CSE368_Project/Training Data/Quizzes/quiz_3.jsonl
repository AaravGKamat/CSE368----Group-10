The Single-Cycle Datapath 

The single-cycle datapath is a foundational design in computer architecture where every instruction in a processor's instruction set is executed within one single, continuous clock cycle. This design philosophy simplifies the conceptual understanding of how a CPU works, as the entire journey of an instruction—from fetch to completion—happens in one coordinated, atomic step.

The datapath itself is the collection of functional units and registers connected by buses that data flows through. For a typical instruction like an add operation (ADD rd, rs, rt), the datapath springs into action. First, the Program Counter (PC) sends an address to the instruction memory to fetch the instruction. This instruction word is then decoded, separating out the fields for the register file addresses (rs and rt).

In the decode stage, the register file reads the values from the two specified source registers. Simultaneously, the control unit, which examines the instruction's opcode, generates the necessary signals to steer the data correctly (e.g., telling the ALU what operation to perform). Next comes the execute stage, where the two register values are sent to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) to be added together.

The result of the ALU operation is then written back into the destination register (rd) during the write-back stage, completing the instruction.

The critical constraint of this design is that the clock cycle must be long enough to accommodate the slowest possible instruction. While a simple ADD might complete quickly, a instruction that requires reading from data memory (like a LOAD) has a much longer propagation delay. This means the clock cycle is dictated by the worst-case path, making the single-cycle design inherently inefficient, as faster instructions are forced to wait for the full cycle to finish.

Despite this inefficiency, the single-cycle datapath is a crucial first step. It provides a clear, unambiguous model for understanding the fundamental components of a CPU—the ALU, register file, and memories—and how they interconnect to bring software instructions to life.
